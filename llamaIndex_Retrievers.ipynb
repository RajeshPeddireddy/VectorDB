        " **Searching for information**: You can use an index to quickly find all of the documents that contain a particular keyword or phrase. This can be useful for research, customer support, or any other task that requires you to find information in a large corpus of text.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Ranking documents**: You can use an index to rank documents by their relevance to a particular query. This can be useful for search engines, recommender systems, or any other application that needs to rank documents.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Analyzing text**: You can use an index to analyze the content of a large corpus of text. This can be useful for understanding the sentiment of a document, identifying topics, or extracting keywords.\n",
