        "LlamaIndex Query Engine offers several response synthesizers to generate meaningful responses from your data. Let‚Äôs explore them:\n",
        "\n",
        "Response Synthesizers: A response synthesizer generates a response from an LLM, using a user query and a given set of retrieved text chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        " **1. Refine Synthesizer:**\n",
        "This synthesizer creates and refines answers by sequentially processing each retrieved text chunk.\n",
        "It makes a separate LLM call per Node/retrieved chunk.\n",
        "Here‚Äôs how it works:\n",
        "The first chunk is used in a query using the text_qa_template prompt.\n",
        "Then, the answer and the next chunk (along with the original question) are used in another query with the refine_template prompt.\n",
        "This process continues until all chunks have been parsed.\n",
        "It‚Äôs suitable for providing more detailed answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " **2. Compact Synthesizer (Default):**\n",
        "Similar to the refine synthesizer, but it concatenates the chunks beforehand.\n",
        "This results in fewer LLM calls.\n",
        "The compact mode is commonly used for efficient responses.\n",
        "\n",
        " **3. Accumulate Synthesizer:**\n",
        "The Accumulate synthesizer accumulates information from multiple chunks.\n",
        "It‚Äôs useful for scenarios where you want to accumulate evidence or context across different parts of the response.\n",
        "You can configure it with various options, such as streaming and asynchronous processing.\n",
        "\n",
        " **4. Other Synthesizers:**\n",
        "LlamaIndex provides additional synthesizers, including:\n",
        "Structured Hierarchical Retrieval: For structured and semi-structured data.\n",
        "JSON Synthesizer: For handling JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Knowledge Graph Synthesizer**: For querying knowledge graphs.\n",
        "Ensemble Synthesizer: For advanced multi-document querying/analysis.\n",
        "Remember, these synthesizers allow you to converse with your data effectively, whether you‚Äôre building a chatbot, a search engine, or any other application! ü¶ôüîçüöÄ\n",
        "\n",
        "For detailed inputs and outputs of each synthesizer, you can refer to the official documentation1.\n"
